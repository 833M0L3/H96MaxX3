# **Installing Ubuntu based Armbian Linux on H96 Max X3 TV Box**

Ok the main question is how did I end up with a TV Box instead of going with the popular miniature computers like Raspberry Pis. The thing is, Raspberry Pis here in my country are frikin expensive compared to these TV Boxes. A base model Raspberry Pi 3 with 1 GB RAM cost around Rs 8000 while I can get a TV Box with same performance CPU and RAM of 4 GB with just Rs 5800, not to forget about the plus points like built in heat sink, pre built plastic box for the board , built in EMMC memory of 32 GB or more, and so on.

So, getting a TV Box is definitely a smart choice. But the problem is getting Linux run on it. Since these TV Boxes comes with Android OS pre installed and has a different way of booting, getting it to work with Linux is very tedious job.
